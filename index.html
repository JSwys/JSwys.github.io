            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Columbus and grew up in central Ohio. I recently lived in Austin, Texas, where I worked mostly in construction and fabrication. I moved back to Columbus in March of 2021 and have been working as a maintenance technician at an industrial artist studio complex in Franklinton. In my free time I love reading, boardgames, yoga and meditation, as well as doing odd construction and landscaping jobs for friends when requested. I've always liked working with my hands. There is something very satisfying seeing something you've built and knowing it works and was done well. However, I was very interested in computers as a kid, and recently I've felt that I may have missed an opportunity to pursue that. So I attended We Can Code IT's bootcamp in Columbus in order to help break into the software development field.</p>
